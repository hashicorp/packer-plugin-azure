Type: `azure-chroot`
Artifact BuilderId: `azure.chroot`

The `azure-chroot` builder is able to build Azure managed disk (MD) images. For
more information on managed disks, see [Azure Managed Disks Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview).

The difference between this builder and the `azure-arm` builder is that this
builder is able to build a managed disk image without launching a new Azure VM
for every build, but instead use an already-running Azure VM. This can
dramatically speed up image builds. It also allows for more deterministic image
content and enables some capabilities that are not possible with the
`azure-arm` builder.

> **This is an advanced builder** If you're just getting started with Packer,
> it is recommend to start with the [azure-arm builder](https://packer.io/docs/builder/azure-arm),
> which is much easier to use.

## How Does it Work?

This builder works by creating a new MD from either an existing source or from
scratch and attaching it to the (already existing) Azure VM where Packer is
running. Once attached, a [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) is set
up and made available to the [provisioners](https://packer.io/docs/provisioners).
After provisioning, the MD is detached, snapshotted and a MD image is created.

Using this process, minutes can be shaved off the image creation process
because Packer does not need to launch a VM instance.

There are some restrictions however:

- The host system must be a similar system (generally the same OS version,
  kernel versions, etc.) as the image being built.
- If the source is a managed disk, it must be made available in the same
  region as the host system.
- The host system SKU has to allow for all of the specified disks to be
  attached.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. We'll start
with authentication parameters, then go over the Azure chroot builder specific
options.

### Authentication options

None of the authentication options are required, but depending on which
ones are specified a different authentication method may be used. See the
[shared Azure builders documentation](https://packer.io/docs/builder/azure) for more
information.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/azure/common/client/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `cloud_environment_name` (string) - One of Public, China, or
  USGovernment. Defaults to Public. Long forms such as
  USGovernmentCloud and AzureUSGovernmentCloud are also supported.

- `metadata_host` (string) - The Hostname of the Azure Metadata Service
  (for example management.azure.com), used to obtain the Cloud Environment
  when using a Custom Azure Environment. This can also be sourced from the
  ARM_METADATA_HOST Environment Variable.
  Note: CloudEnvironmentName must be set to the requested environment
  name in the list of available environments held in the metadata_host.

- `client_id` (string) - The application ID of the AAD Service Principal.
  Requires either `client_secret`, `client_cert_path` or `client_jwt` to be set as well.

- `client_secret` (string) - A password/secret registered for the AAD SP.

- `client_cert_path` (string) - The path to a PKCS#12 bundle (.pfx file) to be used as the client certificate
  that will be used to authenticate as the specified AAD SP.

- `client_cert_password` (string) - The password for decrypting the client certificate bundle.

- `client_jwt` (string) - A JWT bearer token for client auth (RFC 7523, Sec. 2.2) that will be used
  to authenticate the AAD SP. Provides more control over token the expiration
  when using certificate authentication than when using `client_cert_path`.

- `object_id` (string) - The object ID for the AAD SP. Optional, will be derived from the oAuth token if left empty.

- `tenant_id` (string) - The Active Directory tenant identifier with which your `client_id` and
  `subscription_id` are associated. If not specified, `tenant_id` will be
  looked up using `subscription_id`.

- `subscription_id` (string) - The subscription to use.

- `oidc_request_token` (string) - OIDC Request Token is used for GitHub Actions OIDC, this token is used with oidc_request_url to fetch access tokens to Azure
  Value in GitHub Actions can be extracted from the `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` variable
  Refer to [Configure a federated identity credential on an app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions) for details on how setup GitHub Actions OIDC authentication

- `oidc_request_url` (string) - OIDC Request URL is used for GitHub Actions OIDC, this token is used with oidc_request_url to fetch access tokens to Azure
  Value in GitHub Actions can be extracted from the `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` variable

- `use_azure_cli_auth` (bool) - Flag to use Azure CLI authentication. Defaults to false.
  CLI auth will use the information from an active `az login` session to connect to Azure and set the subscription id and tenant id associated to the signed in account.
  If enabled, it will use the authentication provided by the `az` CLI.
  Azure CLI authentication will use the credential marked as `isDefault` and can be verified using `az account show`.
  Works with normal authentication (`az login`) and service principals (`az login --service-principal --username APP_ID --password PASSWORD --tenant TENANT_ID`).
  Ignores all other configurations if enabled.

## Chroot Mounts

The `chroot_mounts` configuration can be used to mount specific devices within
the chroot. By default, the following additional mounts are added into the
chroot by Packer:

- `/proc` (proc)
- `/sys` (sysfs)
- `/dev` (bind to real `/dev`)
- `/dev/pts` (devpts)
- `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` (binfmt_misc)

These default mounts are usually good enough for anyone and are sane defaults.
However, if you want to change or add the mount points, you may using the
`chroot_mounts` configuration. Here is an example configuration which only
mounts `/prod` and `/dev`:

```json
{
  "chroot_mounts": [
    ["proc", "proc", "/proc"],
    ["bind", "/dev", "/dev"]
  ]
}
```

`chroot_mounts` is a list of a 3-tuples of strings. The three components of the
3-tuple, in order, are:

- The filesystem type. If this is "bind", then Packer will properly bind the
  filesystem to another mount point.

- The source device.

- The mount directory.

## Additional template function

Because this builder runs on an Azure VM, there is an additional template function
available called `vm`, which returns the following VM metadata:

- name
- subscription_id
- resource_group
- location
- resource_id

This function can be used in the configuration templates, for example, use

```text
"{{ vm `subscription_id` }}"
```

to fill in the subscription ID of the VM in any of the configuration options.

## Build Shared Information Variables

This builder generates data that are shared with provisioner and post-processor via build function of [template engine](https://packer.io/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for JSON and [contextual variables](https://packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/contextual-variables) for HCL2.

The generated variables available for this builder are:

- `SourceImageName` - The full name of the source image used in the deployment. When using
shared images the resulting name will point to the actual source used to create the said version.
  building the AMI.

Usage example:

**HCL2**

```hcl
// When accessing one of these variables from inside the builder, you need to
// use the golang templating syntax. This is due to an architectural quirk that
// won't be easily resolvable until legacy json templates are deprecated:

{
source "amazon-arm" "basic-example" {
  source = "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
}

// when accessing one of the variables from a provisioner or post-processor, use
// hcl-syntax
post-processor "manifest" {
    output = "manifest.json"
    strip_path = true
    custom_data = {
        source_image_name = "${build.SourceImageName}"
    }
}
```
**JSON**

```json
"post-processors": [
  {
    "type": "manifest",
    "output": "manifest.json",
    "strip_path": true,
    "custom_data": {
      "source_image_name": "{{ build `SourceImageName` }}"
    }
  }
]
```



## Examples

Here are some examples using this builder.
This builder requires privileged actions, such as mounting disks, running
`chroot` and other admin commands. Usually it needs to be run with root
permissions, for example:

```shell-session
$ sudo -E packer build example.pkr.json
```

### Using a VM with a Managed Identity

On a VM with a system-assigned managed identity that has the contributor role
on its own resource group, the following config can be used to create an
updated Debian image:


**HCL2**

```hcl
source "azure-chroot" "example" {
  image_resource_id = "/subscriptions/{{vm `subscription_id`}}/resourceGroups/{{vm `resource_group`}}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyDebianOSImage-{{timestamp}}"
  source            = "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.azure-chroot.example"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline         = ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y"]
    inline_shebang = "/bin/sh -x"
  }
}
```


**JSON**

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "azure-chroot",

      "image_resource_id": "/subscriptions/{{vm `subscription_id`}}/resourceGroups/{{vm `resource_group`}}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyDebianOSImage-{{timestamp}}",
      "source": "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "inline": ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y"],
      "inline_shebang": "/bin/sh -x",
      "type": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Using a Service Principal

Here is an example that creates a Debian image with updated packages. Specify
all environment variables (`ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) to use a service principal.
The identity you choose should have permission to create disks and images and also
to update your VM.
Set the `ARM_IMAGE_RESOURCEGROUP_ID` variable to an existing resource group in the
subscription where the resulting image will be created.

**HCL2**

```hcl
variable "client_id" {
  type = string
}
variable "client_secret" {
  type = string
}
variable "subscription_id" {
  type = string
} variable "resource_group" {
  type = string
}

source "azure-chroot" "basic-example" {
  client_id = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
  subscription_id = var.subscription_id

  image_resource_id = "/subscriptions/${var.subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${var.resource_group}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyDebianOSImage-{{timestamp}}"

  source = "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
}

build {
  sources = ["sources.azure-chroot.basic-example"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y"]
    inline_shebang = "/bin/sh -x"
  }
}
```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "client_id": "{{env `ARM_CLIENT_ID`}}",
    "client_secret": "{{env `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`}}",
    "subscription_id": "{{env `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`}}",
    "resource_group": "{{env `ARM_IMAGE_RESOURCEGROUP_ID`}}"
  },
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "azure-chroot",

      "client_id": "{{user `client_id`}}",
      "client_secret": "{{user `client_secret`}}",
      "subscription_id": "{{user `subscription_id`}}",

      "image_resource_id": "/subscriptions/{{user `subscription_id`}}/resourceGroups/{{user `resource_group`}}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyDebianOSImage-{{timestamp}}",

      "source": "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "inline": ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y"],
      "inline_shebang": "/bin/sh -x",
      "type": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
```
