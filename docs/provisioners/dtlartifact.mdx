# Azure DevTest Lab Artifact Provisioner

Type: `azure-dtlartifact`

The Azure DevTest Labs provisioner can be used to apply an artifact to a VM - See [Add an artifact to a VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-labs/add-artifact-vm)


## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. We'll start
with authentication parameters, then go over the Azure ARM builder specific
options. In addition to the options listed here, a [communicator](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this builder.

### Authentication options

@include 'builder/azure/common/client/Config.mdx'

#### Managed Identity

If you're running Packer on an Azure VM with a [managed identity](/docs/builders/azure#azure-managed-identity) you don't need to specify any additional configuration options. As Packer will attempt to use the Managed Identity and subscription of the VM that Packer is running on.

#### Interactive User Authentication

To use interactive user authentication, you should specify `subscription_id` only.
Packer will use cached credentials or redirect you to a website to log in.

#### Service Principal

To use a [service principal](/docs/builders/azure#azure-active-directory-service-principal)
you should specify `subscription_id`, `client_id` and one of `client_secret`,
`client_cert_path` or `client_jwt`.

- `subscription_id` (string) - Subscription under which the build will be
  performed. **The service principal specified in `client_id` must have full
  access to this subscription, unless build_resource_group_name option is
  specified in which case it needs to have owner access to the existing
  resource group specified in build_resource_group_name parameter.**

- `client_id` (string) - The Active Directory service principal associated with
  your builder.

- `client_secret` (string) - The password or secret for your service principal.

- `client_cert_path` (string) - The location of a PEM file containing a
  certificate and private key for service principal.

- `client_cert_token_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h30m12s") - How long to set the expire time on the token created when using
  `client_cert_path`.

- `client_jwt` (string) - The bearer JWT assertion signed using a certificate
  associated with your service principal principal. See [Azure Active
  Directory docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials)
  for more information.
