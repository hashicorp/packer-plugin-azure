# Azure Key Vault Secret Data Source

The Key Vault Secret data source provides information about an Azure Key Vault's secret,
including its value and metadata.

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic examples of usage:

```hcl
data "azure-keyvaultsecret" "basic-example" {
  vault_name = "packer-test-vault"
  secret_name = "test-secret"
}

# usage example of the data source output
locals {
  value = data.azure-keyvaultsecret.basic-example.value
  payload = data.azure-keyvaultsecret.basic-example.payload
}
```

Reading key-value pairs from JSON back into a native Packer map can be accomplished
with the [jsondecode() function](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/encoding/jsondecode).
