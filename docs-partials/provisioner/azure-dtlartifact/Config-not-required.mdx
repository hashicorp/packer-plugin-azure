- `polling_duration_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The default PollingDuration for azure is 15mins, this property will override
  that value.
  If your Packer build is failing on the
  ARM deployment step with the error `Original Error:
  context deadline exceeded`, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
  its default of "15m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
  minutes, and `h` for hours.)

- `azure_tags` (map[string]\*string) - Azure Tags
