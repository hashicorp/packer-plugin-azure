Config allows for various ways to authenticate Azure clients.  When
`client_id` and `subscription_id` are specified in addition to one and only
one of the following: `client_secret`, `client_jwt`, `client_cert_path` --
Packer will use the specified Azure Active Directory (AAD) Service Principal
(SP).
If none ofthese options are specified, Packer will attempt to use the Managed Identity
and subscription of the VM that Packer is running on.  This will only work if
Packer is running on an Azure VM with either a System Assigned Managed
Identity or User Assigned Managed Identity.
