- `subscription` (string) - Sig Destination Subscription

- `resource_group` (string) - Sig Destination Resource Group

- `gallery_name` (string) - Sig Destination Gallery Name

- `image_name` (string) - Sig Destination Image Name

- `image_version` (string) - Sig Destination Image Version

- `replication_regions` ([]string) - A list of regions to replicate the image version in, by default the build location will be used as a replication region (the build location is either set in the location field, or the location of the resource group used in `build_resource_group_name` will be included.
  Can not contain any region but the build region when using shallow replication

- `target_region` ([]TargetRegion) - A target region to store the image version in. The attribute supersedes `replication_regions` which is now considered deprecated.
  One or more target_region blocks can be specified for storing an imager version to various regions. In addition to specifying a region,
  a DiskEncryptionSetId can be specified for each target region to support multi-region disk encryption.
  At a minimum their must be one target region entry for the primary build region where the image version will be stored.
  Target region must only contain one entry matching the build region when using shallow replication.

- `storage_account_type` (string) - Specify a storage account type for the Shared Image Gallery Image Version.
  Defaults to `Standard_LRS`. Accepted values are `Standard_LRS`, `Standard_ZRS` and `Premium_LRS`

- `specialized` (bool) - Set to true if publishing to a Specialized Gallery, this skips a call to set the build VM's OS state as Generalized

- `use_shallow_replication` (bool) - Setting a `shared_image_gallery_replica_count` or any `replication_regions` is unnecessary for shallow builds, as they can only replicate to the build region and must have a replica count of 1
  Refer to [Shallow Replication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=azure-cli#shallow-replication) for details on when to use shallow replication mode.

- `confidential_vm_image_encryption_type` (string) - The ConfidentialVM Image Encryption Type for the Shared Image Gallery Destination. This can be either "EncryptedVMGuestStateOnlyWithPmk" (enabled), "EncryptedWithPmk" (supported), or "EncryptedWithCmk" (DES enabled). This option is used to publish a VM image to a Shared Image Gallery as a confidential VM image.
