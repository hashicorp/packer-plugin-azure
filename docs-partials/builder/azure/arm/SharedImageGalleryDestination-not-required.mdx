- `subscription` (string) - Sig Destination Subscription

- `resource_group` (string) - Sig Destination Resource Group

- `gallery_name` (string) - Sig Destination Gallery Name

- `image_name` (string) - Sig Destination Image Name

- `image_version` (string) - Sig Destination Image Version

- `replication_regions` ([]string) - A list of regions to replicate the image version in, by default the build location will be used as a replication region (the build location is either set in the location field, or the location of the resource group used in `build_resource_group_name` will be included.
  Can not contain any region but the build region when using shallow replication

- `target_regions` ([]TargetRegion) - Sig Destination Target Replication Regions

- `storage_account_type` (string) - Specify a storage account type for the Shared Image Gallery Image Version.
  Defaults to `Standard_LRS`. Accepted values are `Standard_LRS`, `Standard_ZRS` and `Premium_LRS`

- `specialized` (bool) - Set to true if publishing to a Specialized Gallery, this skips a call to set the build VM's OS state as Generalized

- `use_shallow_replication` (bool) - Setting a `shared_image_gallery_replica_count` or any `replication_regions` is unnecessary for shallow builds, as they can only replicate to the build region and must have a replica count of 1
  Refer to [Shallow Replication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=azure-cli#shallow-replication) for details on when to use shallow replication mode.
