- `disk_encryption_set_id` (string) - DiskEncryptionSetId for Disk Encryption Set in Region. Needed for supporting
  the replication of encrypted disks across regions. CMKs must
  already exist within the target regions.

- `replicas` (int64) - The number of replicas of the Image Version to be created within the region. Defaults to 1.
  Replica count must be between 1 and 100, but 50 replicas should be sufficient for most use cases.
  When using shallow replication `use_shallow_replication=true` the value can only be 1 for the primary build region.
